# Crypto Exchange app

## Overview

This README provides instructions on how to set up and run the Vite app.

To start the development server:

Using npm:

    ```
    npm run dev
    ```

Using Yarn:

    ```
    yarn dev
    ```

This will start the app in development mode.  Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser to view it.  The port may vary; check your terminal output for the correct address.

## Building for Production

To build the app for production:

Using npm:

    ```
    npm run build
    ```

Using Yarn:

    ```
    yarn build
    ```


This will create a `dist` folder with the production-ready files, optimized for deployment.

## Additional Scripts

-   To preview the production build *locally*:

    Using npm:

    ```
    npm run preview
    ```

    Using Yarn:

    ```
    yarn preview
    ```

    **Note:** This serves the contents of the `dist` folder. It's useful for testing your production build before deploying.

## Deployment

The contents of the `dist` folder can be deployed to any static hosting service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, AWS S3).  Refer to the documentation of your chosen hosting provider for specific instructions.
